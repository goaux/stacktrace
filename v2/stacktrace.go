// Package stacktrace provides utilities for capturing and inspecting call
// stacks associated with errors.
//
// This package allows you to create error objects that include information
// about where in the code the error occurred, which can be extremely useful
// for debugging. It includes methods to unwrap underlying errors, retrieve
// call stack frames, and generate string representations of errors with
// detailed stack trace information.
